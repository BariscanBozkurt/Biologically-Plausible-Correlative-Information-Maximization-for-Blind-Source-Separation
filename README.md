# LDMI-Based-BSS

Log-Determinant Mutual Information Based Online Blind Source Separation

# TASK

This repo contains the development of Log-Determinant Mutual Information based online blind source separation algorithm for antisparse/sparse, nonnegative-antisparse/sparse cases.

# TODO

-> Debugging the code for antisparse BSS setting

-> Write the neural network as a model class.

-> Implement nonnegative-antisparse BSS setting.

-> Implement sparse BSS setting.

-> Implement nonnegative-sparse setting.

-> Provide extensive numerical experiments.

# Implementation Notes

-> "Notebook_Experiments" folder contains my own experiments for debugging purpose. The corresponding notebooks will be deleted after I complete the debugging and provide the finished experiments in "Numerical_Experiments" folder.

-> "Numerical_Experiments" folder will contain the experiments by using the framework LDMIBSS.

-> "src" folder will contain the source code for the framework LDMIBSS.
