To simulate the video separation experiment presented in the paper, you can follow the below guidelines.

* First, create a folder called "Original-Videos" inside this file.
* Secondly, download the three videos whose links given in the text file 'VideoCredits.txt', name them as follows: "BIRD.mp4", "SHIP.mp4", "GUITAR.mp4", respectively.
* Next, run the python script normalizevideos.py
``` python normalizevideos.py```
* The above step will create a folder "Frames" containing the frames to be used in the experiment.
* Finally, you can open "CorInfoMax_Video_Separation_Experiment2.ipynb" notebook to replicate the video separation experiment.
